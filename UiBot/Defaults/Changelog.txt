1.0.0-beta
-Minor UI Tweaks
-Added Volume adjustments to custom sound clips

-Added Loop Mouse to position. Now you can set a position and "stick" your mouse cursor there
-Adjusted command execution patterns so Async commands correctly execute after or during a delay. This should help with some timing issues
