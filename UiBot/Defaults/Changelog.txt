1.0.02-beta
-Minor UI Tweaks
-Added Volume adjustments to custom sound clips
-Added Xbox Mappings(buttons only)
-Added Loop Mouse to position. Now you can set a position and "stick" your mouse cursor there
-Adjusted command execution patterns so Async commands correctly execute after or during a delay. This should help with some timing issues
-Updated Pixelate Screen with normal non Sync command. Useful if you wish to stack multiple after another
-Removed Trader Menu as it doesn't fit what I'm planning on doing. the !traders command is still available for chat.
-Added option for if commands are paused, it will tell the user that it is paused when they try to run a command. If you pause the commands on the menu, it will notify chat as well
-I made a terrible icon for now
-Added Shutdown PC
-Added Restart PC
-Adjusted the pause out of raid feature. It does not currently save its state and will need to be turned on each time till I rewrite how it checks. Will need to do further testing to make sure it fully functions
